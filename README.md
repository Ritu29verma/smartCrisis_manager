🚨 Smart Crisis Manager
Team Name: CODECOMMANDERS
Deployed Link: Smart Crisis Manager
Repository: GitHub Repo

📖 Overview
Emergencies like accidents, medical crises, or panic attacks often leave people frozen, confused, or unable to act quickly. Right now, users must juggle multiple actions: call emergency numbers, inform family, find the nearest hospital — all while under extreme stress.

❗ The Problem
Manual steps. Stress delays. Poor coordination.

No app lets you trigger multiple life-saving actions at once.

✅ Our Solution
Smart Crisis Manager – an AI-powered emergency assistant that automates life-saving tasks during crises.

🔑 Key Features
One-tap or voice-activated trigger

Understands emergencies in natural language

Detects severity of situation using AI

Instantly alerts family & friends

Finds nearest hospitals or emergency centers

Books appointments or calls ambulances automatically

Shares real-time GPS location with responders

⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ Trigger → Text / Voice / Gesture (e.g., double-press key or “Help me!”)
2️⃣ Intent Detection → AI analyzes urgency (Planned with LangGraph)
3️⃣ Agent Coordination → Divide tasks (Alert family, locate hospital, book appointment)
4️⃣ Execution → Calls, texts, directions, booking (Planned with OmniDimension)
